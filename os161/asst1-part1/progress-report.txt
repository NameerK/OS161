We worked on trying to implement a basic solution to the traffic management problem. We worked on getting a basic 
understanding of the lock API's by reading through the code and documentation. We also messed around by implementing 
different locks and parts of locks to see how they work and interact with each other before removing them. We got a better 
understanding of the conditions that could create a deadlock and what we should do to avoid them. Decided against using
one big lock to control access to the critical section and instead use multiple locks to control different parts of the 
intersection. Looked at implementing print statements to help keep track of what was happening but haven't decided on how
to do that yet. 
Responsibilities for Nameer will be to further look at implementing print statements.
Responsibilities for Max will be to continue to test deadlock conditions and prevention.
Responisibilties for both of us will be to work on successfully implementing multiple locks to control traffic.
